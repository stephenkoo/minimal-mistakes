## Hi, I’m Stephen.

I’m a front-end developer who dabbles with app & back-end development.

I’m most experienced with front-end tech like **JavaScript, ReactJS + Webpack, SASS, CSS, and HTML5**.

I’m passionate about back-end and iOS development - especially with languages like **Golang, Elixir, Node.js and Swift**.

Currently in a innovative, hip digital agency called [Inlight][inlight] - building interesting & ambitious web apps for
clients like [ahm][ahm insurance], [SGIO][sgio] & [SGIC Insurance][sgic], [Cobram Estate][cobram], and
[Chadstone Shopping Centre][chadstone].

When I’m not building web apps, I’ll be out camping, audiobook-ing [(check out my current favourite book)][name of the wind],
practicing the salsa (rather badly), doing calisthenics, messing with my guitar and practicing Swift.

Not all at once though.

I’ve also worked in product management, growth hacking, business development, digital marketing and sales for amazing
tech startups like [Zomato][zomato], [Flippa][flippa], and [Sitepoint][sitepoint].

If you think I’m a cool guy (I am) that you’d like to work with or just to hang out, shoot me an email at
[stephenyrkoo@gmail.com][gmail].
