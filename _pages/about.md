# Hi, I'm Stephen.

I'm a recently turned full-stack developer.
I have experience building Rails and Node web applications, using JavaScript libraries like Angular, and responsive front-end design. I'm currently learning React, Go, and AWS.

I used to work in product management, growth hacking, business development, digital marketing and sales for amazing tech startups like [Zomato][zomato], [Flippa][flippa], and [Sitepoint][sitepoint]. 
I decided I wanted to be a developer so that I can build life-changing and elegant products with other brilliant, intelligent developers and engineers.

When I'm not coding or learning to code, you can find me in a new cafe taking awkward foodshots, on a tram listening to audiobooks on entrepreneurship and startups, or at home watching anime and occasionally playing a single-player RPG like the Witcher 3.
I'm not entirely sure why you'll be in my home though...


If you think you'd like working with me or chatting with me over a cup of coffee, send me an email at [stephenyrkoo@gmail.com][gmail].
